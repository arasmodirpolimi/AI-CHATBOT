# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# AI-Enhanced Chatbot using React, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Deep Seek

This project is a modern, AI-powered chatbot application built with **React** and integrated with both **OpenAI's GPT API** and **Google Gemini**, and **Deep Seek** enabling intelligent, real-time conversational experiences on the web.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Developed as part of my AI/NLP work, this chatbot leverages powerful language models to understand and respond to user queries in a natural and context-aware manner. The frontend is implemented using **React** and **JavaScript**, while the backend API connects to large language models for dynamic interaction.

## 🔍 Features
